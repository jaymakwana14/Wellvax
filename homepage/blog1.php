                         pregnancy puts you at higher risk of severe illness compared to people who are not pregnant.While there is less data available on vaccination of pregnant people,evidence on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy has been growing, and no safety concerns have been identified.

                    <p class=""align = "justify">Yes, if you are breastfeeding you should take the vaccine as soon as it is available to you. 
                        It is very safe and there is no risk to the mother or baby. None of the current COVID-19 vaccines have live virus in them, 
                        so there is no risk of you transmitting COVID-19 to your baby through your breastmilk from the vaccine. In fact,
                        the antibodies that you have after vaccination may go through the breast milk and help protect your baby.</p>

                        The best thing you can do is to take all necessary precautions to prevent yourself from contracting COVID-19.
                         If you’re pregnant or have just given birth and feel sick,
                         then you should seek medical care promptly and follow instructions from your health care provider.</p>

                        such as staying home and practicing physical distancing when outside. Find out what options are available to you from your healthcare provider. 
                        After your child is born, it is also important to continue receiving professional support and guidance, including routine immunizations.

                        who is supporting you through your pregnancy and birth. 
                        They will be able to advise you on the risks and the safest option depending on your personal situation and local health care system..</p>

Yes, you can get vaccinated if you are pregnant. Although the overall risk of severe illness from COVID-19 remains low, pregnancy puts you at higher risk of severe illness compared to people who are not pregnant. While there is less data available on vaccination of pregnant people, evidence on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy has been growing, and no safety concerns have been identified.

                    <p class=""align = "justify">The COVID-19 pandemic has been a stressful and uncertain time for everyone, and especially for those about to give birth.
                         Having a plan in place for your birth can help ease feelings of anxiety by giving you more of a sense of control, but also recognize that some aspects may need to change depending on the situation where you live. 
                        Your plan should include who to phone when your labour begins and who will be providing support. Find out if there are any restrictions at the hospital for support people or family members.
    Do some simple things at home to relax like stretches, breathing exercises and calling your midwife when you feel the need.
                Stay connected with family and friends, eat well, sleep well and focus on taking care of yourself.
 It is a difficult time, but try to enjoy being pregnant as much as you possibly can.</p>

                    <h4 class="lead ">What questions should I be asking my healthcare provider?</h4>
                    <p class=""align = "justify">It is important to establish a trusting relationship with your healthcare provider. “All of those questions that have to do with you and your health, I would ask them freely,” says Franka Cadée, President of the International Confederation of Midwives. “If you have an open relationship with your healthcare provider – with your midwife, with your obstetrician – they will discuss these things with you and answer you openly. It is your absolute right to know these things because it’s your body and your baby.”

Cadée recommends creating a system of how and when to communicate with your healthcare provider. For example, organize a routine around appointments, and how to get in touch for urgent care. It may also be helpful to talk to care providers in advance about obtaining a copy of your health records including record of prenatal care, in case of any disruption or change in services.</p>

                    <p class=""align = "justify">If you have or suspect you may have COVID-19, it is important to seek medical care early and follow instructions from your health care provider.

Remember that you and your child have the right to high quality care throughout your pregnancy and after childbirth.</p>
