            <h4 class="lead ">If you're a parent of young children, you're likely wondering when your kids will be eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine.</h4>
                    <p class=""align = "justify">As of this fall, everyone ages 5 and older is now eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. But since the vaccines have yet to be authorized for use in children under 5, a big question remains: When will younger children be able to get their shots?

While it’s true that most children rarely get very sick from COVID-19, many parents won’t (and shouldn’t) feel comfortable returning to life as normal until their children are fully vaccinated, too, says Sean O’Leary, M.D., M.P.H., vice chair of the Committee for Infectious Diseases at the American Academy of Pediatrics and professor of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus/Children’s Hospital Colorado.

Here’s when vaccines may become available for your little one, and how to keep kids safe in the interim in the midst of the Omicron variant.</p>

                    <p class=""align = "justify">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has fully approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for those 16 and older and authorized it for emergency use for those between the ages of 5 and 15. (Moderna's vaccine — marketed as Spikevax — is fully approved for adults over 18, and the Johnson & Johnon/Janssen Pharmaceuticals vaccine is also authorized for emergency use in adults.)

Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends adolescents ages 12 to 17 years old receive a booster shot five months after completing their vaccination series for further protection against Omicron and other variants.

Children younger than 5 will have to wait to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Pfizer and BioNTech is still studying the use of its vaccine in kids ages 6 months to 4 years.

The companies are currently evaluating the use of a third dose in this age group after finding that a two-dose series produced an insufficient immune response in children ages 2 to 4. They expect to obtain results in early April and will then submit the data to the FDA for an emergency use authorization (EUA). </p>
