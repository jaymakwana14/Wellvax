                    <p class=""align = "justify">Cut up cucumbers are a rejuvenating snack anytime of the day. For your baby’s ease, the best way to cut them is lengthwise, making “cucumber-sticks” shaped like French fries. If it’s a hot summer day, a few cucumbers can easily prevent dehydration.</p>

                    <p class=""align = "justify">Dal is packed with protein, which helps in muscle development. Dal curry can be eaten with rice or chapatti and it doesn’t have a strong flavour. Be sure to cut up the chapatti into little nibble size pieces.</p>

                    <p class=""align = "justify">A regular food for the family that can easily be eaten by the baby, too. The stuffing of vegetables or paneer makes it a balanced meal.</p>

                    <p class=""align = "justify">Be careful to buy organic chicken, or chicken that is certified to be free of hormonal treatments. Over cooking the chicken to make it softer is a good idea for your toddler. Also, avoid strongly spicy flavourings, and tear the cooked meat into tiny bits, removing the bones before your feed it to your child.</p>

                    <p class=""align = "justify">When preparing fish, always remember that frying it makes it lose a lot of its nutritional value, as opposed to using it in a curry. Like chicken, and indeed, more so, be very</p>
